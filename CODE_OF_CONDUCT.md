# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

We value the health and well-being of our people, our animals, and our world above all else. Our mission is to provide a safe, healthy, and nurturing environment for every animal. We uphold transparent practices, value ongoing education, and strive to foster positive relationships with both our animals and the wider community. This commitment to ethics and responsible breeding is core to who we are, and we believe that it should extend to all interactions within our community.

This Code of Conduct outlines the standards we expect from contributors to ensure that our shared values are reflected in our collaborations, discussions, and actions. By participating, you help us maintain a positive and welcoming environment for all.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of biology, identity, level of experience, circumstance, or preference between cats and dogs.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We encourage the productive, civil exchange of knowledge, ideas, and views.

We pledge to uphold the highest standards of care for every animal entrusted to us.

We do not discriminate based on any characteristic, and we believe every animal has an inherent right to a healthy and fulfilling life.
