# Contributing to Bizarre Friends

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Before you begin, please make sure you have read the [documentation](/wiki).

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the this document completely before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. üéâ

To get started, please search for existing [Discussions](/discussions) or [Issues](/issues) that you can join.

And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

- Star the project
- Refer this project in your project's readme
- Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

## I Have a Question

- Open a [Q&A](/discussions/new?category=q-a).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide the platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and platform version you're using.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect as much information as you can about the bug:
  - Any error messages
  - A stack trace (Traceback)
  - Platform and platform version (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Bug Report](issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements

- Suggest new or changed functionality by opening an [Feature Request](issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

#### How Do I Submit a Good Feature or Enhancement Request?

- Ensure that your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case for the merits of this feature.
- Use a clear and descriptive title to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Explain the expected benefits of the change.
- Identify who would benefit from the change (e.g. everyone, breeders, care providers).
- You may want to include screenshots, wireframes, or diagrams which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. Please do not include animated GIF files.

### Improving The Documentation

- We use the GitHub wiki for our [documentation](/wiki). To suggest changes please open an [Documentation Request](/new?template=documentation_request.yml).
