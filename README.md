# Bizarre Friends

# Introduction

Bizarre Friends is a user-friendly, cross-platform tool tailored for breeders of all kinds of animals. It allows users to manage animal health records, breeding logs, and care schedules all in one place. Designed to work offline, the application offers seamless data organization without requiring internet access, with optional features for syncing data across devices and accessing online services. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, it provides breeders with the tools they need to ensure the well-being and proper management of their animals.

# Goals

1. **Support for Diverse Animals, Including Exotics**  
   Develop a versatile tool that allows breeders to efficiently manage the care, breeding, and health records of various animals, particularly exotic pets. The tool will offer intuitive tracking and organizational features to meet the needs of breeders across a wide range of species.

2. **Promote Animal Health and Welfare**  
   Provide breeders with tools that help track and improve animal health care, promoting best practices for animal welfare. Features like health logs, feeding schedules, and medical history tracking will ensure breeders can easily maintain high standards of care for their animals.

3. **Enable Community Contribution**  
   Make the tool Open Source to foster collaboration and feedback from the breeder community. This will allow breeders to share feature requests, improvements, and best practices, contributing to a shared platform that benefits the entire community.

4. **Ensure Cross-Platform and Offline Functionality**  
   Build the tool to be fully functional across multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. It will operate without requiring an internet connection, ensuring breeders can manage their operations anytime, anywhere.

5. **Commit to Ethical Breeding Practices**  
   Focus on creating features that support responsible and ethical breeding practices, helping breeders meet high standards of care. The tool will encourage practices that prioritize the well-being of animals and uphold ethical standards in breeding operations.

6. **Enhance Post-Sale Customer Interaction and Retention**  
   Without turning the tool into a CRM, provide offline features to improve education, sale, and post-sale interactions with customers.
