# Cross platform development framework

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2024-09-20

## Context and Problem Statement

Choos a cross platform development framework that supports Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS

## Considered Options

* Flutter
* Tauri
* React Native

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Flutter", because React Native does not fully support all required platforms. Tauri was a close second, but the 2.0 release, which is required for mobile support, is in beta. Flutter is a fairly mature framework with a good community and selection of packages.
